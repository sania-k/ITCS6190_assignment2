Line1 Chapter 1: Prologue — Three Ways to Survive an Apocalypse
Line2 There are three ways to survive an apocalypse. I have forgotten some of them now, but one thing is certain: you, who are currently reading these words, will survive.
Line3 — Three Ways to Survive an Apocalypse [Complete]
Line4 A web novel platform filled the screen of my old cell phone. I scrolled down, and then up again, as I attempted to refresh the page over and over.
Line5 “Seriously? This is the end?” 
Line6 I looked again. The “complete” was unmistakable. The story was over.
Line7 『Three Ways to Survive an Apocalypse』
Line8 Author: tls123
Line9 3,149 chapters
Line10 Three Ways to Survive an Apocalypse was a feature-length fantasy novel with 3,149 chapters. It was called “TWSA” for short.
Line11 I had been steadily reading this novel since my third year of middle school. I had consistently read it through being harassed and ostracized by my bullies at my school; when I’d screwed up my college entrance exams and had ended up at a third-rate university in the sticks; when I’d gotten screwed over by the military draft lottery, and had been shipped off to the godforsaken DMZ...Even now when I’ve barely managed to land a job as a temporary worker at some conglomerate affiliate after job-hopping…
Line12 Damn it, let’s just stop this story here. Anyway.
Line13 Author's Note: Thank you so much for reading TWSA up to here. I will come back to you with the epilogue.
Line14 “Ah...So, there’s still an epilogue left. Then the next chapter’s really the last one.” 
Line15 It was a long journey that had spanned over ten years—from the end of my childhood all the way to adulthood. I felt a mixture of emptiness that a world was coming to an end, along with a sense of fulfillment from finally being able to reach its conclusion. I opened the comment section for the latest chapter to write and rewrite my comment several times.
Line16 — Kim Dokja: Author-nim, thank you for everything so far. I’m looking forward to the epilogue.
Line17 They were heartfelt words. “TWSA was the novel of my life”. “It wasn't the most popular, but it was the best novel for me”. There were many things I wanted to write, but I couldn't bring myself to type any of them. I was afraid that my careless words might hurt the author.
Line18 — An average of 1.9 hits per chapter. 
Line19 — An average of 1.08 comments.
Line20 This was the popularity index of TWSA. The number of views for the first chapter was 1,200, but it fell to 120 for the tenth chapter, and then 12 by the fiftieth. By the time the novel had reached the hundredth chapter, it was only 1.
Line21 1 View
Line22 I was weirdly moved when I saw those numerous 1’s next to the list of the chapters. In some cases, there’d be a 2, but that was probably a missclick. 
Line23 I was grateful.
Line24 The author had serialized a novel over a period of ten years that had more than three thousand chapters, and only 1 view per chapter. 
Line25 This was truly a story written just for me, wasn’t it? 
Line26 — I have a banger novel to recommend.
Line27 I clicked on the [Recommendation Board] and tapped on my keyboard without thinking.
Line28 The author had written a complete novel for me for free, so the least I could do was give him a recommendation. The comments started pouring in as soon as I hit “submit”.
Line29 — It looks like a new type of anti. I searched for this ID, and they recommended the same novel multiple times.
Line30 — Isn’t self-recommendation banned? Author-nim, you shouldn’t be doing this here.
Line31 I belatedly realized that I’d already written a recommendation a few months ago. 
Line32 In an instant, dozens of comments appeared filled with rhetoric such as “attention seeker” or “dumbass”. My face became flushed. 
Line33 I was sure the author would also see this. I frantically tried to remove my post, but all I got was a message that said it couldn't be deleted because it had already been reported.
Line34 “This…” 
Line35 A bitter taste filled my mouth at the thought that my sincere recommendation had ended up becoming just a stain on the novel's reputation. 
Line36 If people would just give it a chance, they’d be in for a real treat… 
Line37 Why was nobody reading this gem? I wanted to at least donate to the writer, but I couldn't afford it as a salary worker who was living paycheck to paycheck.
Line38 Then I received a notification that a DM had arrived.
Line39 tls123: Thank you.
Line40 The message came as a surprise. I needed a moment to process it.
Line41 Kim Dokja: Author-nim? 
Line42 tls123…It was the author of TWSA.
Line43 tls123: I was able to complete it thanks to you. I also won the competition.
Line44 I couldn't believe it. That TWSA had won a competition? 
Line45 Kim Dokja: Congratulations! What’s the competition? 
Line46 tls123: Even if I tell you, you probably will not know it because it is an obscure competition.
Line47 Were they lying to save face? I thought they might be, but I also hoped it was true. Who knew? Yeah, it had flopped here, but maybe it was a hit on another platform. A part of me was disappointed, but it was good to have an excellent story spread.
Line48 tls123: I would like to send a special gift to you as a thank you, Reader-nim. 
Line49 Kim Dokja: Gift?
Line50 tls123: This story could only emerge into this world because of you, Reader-nim.
Line51 I gave the author my email address when they asked. 
Line52 tls123: Ah, right. I have received the monetization schedule.
Line53 Kim Dokja: Wow, really? When will it start? This masterpiece should've been paid for from the start...
Line54 It was a lie. TWSA was updated daily, so I would've had to spend 3,000₩ a month. 3,000₩ was one convenience store lunch for me.
Line55 tls123: The paid service starts tomorrow.
Line56 Kim Dokja: Then the epilogue will also be paid?
Line57 tls123: Yes, I am afraid you will need to pay for it. 
Line58 Kim Dokja: Of course I have to pay! I’ll be sure to buy the last chapter!
Line59 After that, there was no reply from the author. It looked like they had logged out of the site. A sense of despondency settled in. 
Line60 So now that he’s successful, he’s just leaving me on read? 
Line61 My admiration turned into petty jealousy. What was I so excited about? It wasn't like I had written the novel anyway.
Line62 “Will he give me a gift certificate? It'd be nice if it was the 50,000₩ one.” 
Line63 Those were the naïve thoughts I’d had back then. 
Line64 I knew nothing about what would happen to the world the next day.
Line65 Chapter 2: Ep. 1 — Starting the Paid Service, I
Line66 “I'm Dokja.”
Line67 I would usually introduce myself to people like this, and then the following misunderstanding would occur:
Line68 “Oh, are you an only child?”
Line69 “I am, but that isn't what I mean.”
Line70 “Huh? Then…?”
Line71 “My name is Dokja. Kim Dokja.”
Line72 Kim Dokja. My father gave me that name so that I would become a strong man even if I was on my own. But thanks to that, I was instead living as your average lonely guy. In short, my life was like this: 
Line73 Kim Dokja, 28 years old, single. 
Line74 My hobby is reading web novels on the subway while going home from work.
Line75 “If you keep that up, you might get sucked into your phone.” 
Line76 A familiar voice cut through the noisy subway. I raised my head reflexively to see a pair of curious eyes staring straight at me. They belonged to an employee from the Human Resources department, Yoo Sangah.
Line77 "Ah, hello," I greeted her. 
Line78 “Are you heading home from work?" 
Line79 "Yes. What about you, Yoo Sangah-ssi?"
Line80 "I was lucky today since our department head went on a business trip." 
Line81 She sat down as soon as the seat next to me became vacant. Her shoulder pressed against mine, and a subtle scent of perfume wafted from her. I tensed up despite myself.
Line82 "Do you normally take the subway?" I asked.
Line83 "Well..." 
Line84 Her expression darkened. Come to think of it, this was the first time I'd met her on the subway. And it was no wonder. There was a well-known rumor at the office that men—from HR Assistant Manager Kang to Finance Department Head Han—lined up to offer to drive Yoo Sangah home every evening. 
Line85 But the most unexpected words came from her mouth. 
Line86 "Someone stole my bicycle."
Line87 Bicycle? 
Line88 "You commute by bike?"
Line89 "Yeah! I gradually stopped getting enough exercise with all of the overtime I’ve had to do lately. There were also some other issues…So, let’s just say I’m killing two birds with one stone.”
Line90 Aha, so that's how it is. 
Line91 She smiled brightly. Seeing her up close like this, I could somewhat understand why most men would fall for her so easily. Nevertheless, it had nothing to do with me. Every person had their own genres of life, and she was living in a genre different from mine. 
Line92 We looked at our phones as the conversation awkwardly ended. I opened up the novel app I had been using to read earlier while Yoo Sangah…
Line93 What is this?
Line94 "¿Puede prestarme dinero?"
Line95 "Huh?”
Line96 "It’s Spanish."
Line97 "...I see. What does it mean?"
Line98 "‘Can you lend me money’," she replied proudly. 
Line99 Studying on the subway while going home...She truly is living in a genre different from mine. Where is she planning to use a phrase like that?
Line100 "You're working diligently."
Line101 "And what are you looking at so diligently, Dokja-ssi?”
Line102 "Ah, I..."
Line103 Gah! Her eyes were already glued to the screen of my phone. 
Line104 "Is that a novel?"
Line105 "Yes, well...You could say that I'm studying Korean."
Line106 "Wow, I like reading novels too! It's been a while since I’ve had time to read, though, but I–"
Line107 That’s unexpected. She likes novels? 
Line108 "–like Murakami Haruki, Raymond Carver and Han Kang..." 
Line109 Ah, of course. 
Line110 “Who’s your favorite author, Dokja-ssi?”
Line111 "Even if I tell you, you probably won't know them."
Line112 "Despite how I may look, I’ve read a lot of novels. Whose work is it?"
Line113 Times like these make my web novel hobby genuinely embarrassing. 
Line114 I glanced at the title of the novel in the app.
Line115 『The World After the Fall』 
Line116 Author: singNsong
Line117 I couldn't just say “I’m reading The World After the Fall by singNsong.” 
Line118 "It's just a fantasy novel. It's like...What was it again? Right; The Lord of the Rings. It's kind of like that."
Line119 Her eyes widened.
Line120 "Ah! The Lord of the Rings. I've watched the movies."
Line121 "Yeah, the movies are good." 
Line122 A brief silence followed. She was still looking at me, and seemed to be waiting for me to say something. 
Line123 …It was getting awkward. I decided to change the topic. 
Line124 "Now that I think about it, it's already been a year since we joined the company, hasn't it? Time really flies."
Line125 "Tell me about it. The two of us had no idea what was going on back then, did we?"
Line126 "That's right. It seems like it was just yesterday, but our contracts are already almost up." 
Line127 It was only after I saw her expression did I realize I had chosen the wrong topic.
Line128 "Ah, I’m..." she trailed off. 
Line129 I had forgotten that she had already been promoted to a full-time employee after she’d received recognition for securing a foreign investor contract last month.
Line130 “Oh, right. I should’ve congratulated you earlier. Sorry. Haha, I should've diligently studied foreign languages, too.”
Line131 "N-no, not at all, Dokja-ssi! There's still the performance review, and..." 
Line132 I didn't want to admit it, but the sight of Yoo Sangah speaking was pretty charming. Her face seemed to be glowing brilliantly, as though the world's spotlight was shining down on her alone.
Line133 If this world was a novel, the protagonist would likely be someone like her. 
Line134 In fact, it would be a logical outcome.
Line135 While I hadn't put in any effort…She had.
Line136 While I had read web novels on the internet...She had studied diligently. 
Line137 So, it was only natural that she was promoted to a full-time employee and my contract was terminated.
Line138 "Um...Dokja-ssi." 
Line139 "Yes?"
Line140 "If you don't mind...do you want to know the app I'm using?" 
Line141 All of a sudden, her voice sounded distant. 
Line142 It felt like the world was growing endlessly away from me. I blinked hard and stared straight ahead to ground my drifting mind. 
Line143 There was a boy sitting in the seat opposite of mine. He couldn’t have been more than ten. He was sitting next to his mother, and looking at the insect container in his lap with gloomy eyes.
Line144 "...Dokja-ssi?"
Line145 What would it be like if I’d had a different life? 
Line146 Or rather, what if the genre of my life had been different?
Line147 "Kim Dok…"
Line148 If the genre of my life wasn’t “realism”, but “fantasy” instead...
Line149 Would I have been able to become the protagonist? 
Line150 Who knows. 
Line151 That was something I’d likely never know. 
Line152 But if there was one I did know, it was…
Line153 "It's fine, Yoo Sangah-ssi."
Line154 "Huh?"
Line155 "Even if you tell me the app, it won't be of any use." 
Line156 …that the genre of my life was undeniably “realism”...
Line157 "It's because a Dokja has a dokja life, you see."
Line158 "Hm? What do you–?"
Line159 "It's just that some people are like that in life." 
Line160 …and in this genre, I wasn't a “protagonist”, but a “reader”.
Line161 "A dokja’s life..." 
Line162 Yoo Sangah looked concerned, so I waved my hand a bit to show that I was really alright. I didn't really know why, but this person seemed sincerely worried about me. Well, she was from HR...so she would have no illusions about my poor work performance leading up to evaluation.
Line163 “Dokja-ssi, you really have a way with words.”
Line164 "What?" 
Line165 "Then, I suppose I have my own life as well. A sangah life." 
Line166 She seemed to have come to some sort of a decision as she determinedly turned back to studying Spanish. I stared at her for a while before also returning to my web novel. 
Line167 Everything had gone back to the way it should be, but I strangely couldn’t scroll up on my novel as easily as I once did. Maybe the reminder of the heavy weight of reality had anchored itself to the bottom of the screen. 
Line168 Just then, a notification appeared at the top of my phone. 
Line169 [You have one new email.]
Line170 It was from the author of TWSA. I opened the mail.
Line171 Reader-nim, the paid service will start today at 7 p.m. This will be helpful. Good luck. 
Line172 [1 attachment]
Line173 Come to think of it, they said they would send a gift. Was this it? 
Line174 ...I must really be a reader by nature to get this excited over a single email…
Line175 Well, living as a reader isn’t all bad. 
Line176 I checked the time. 
Line177 6:55PM. I had exactly five minutes before the novel became monetized at 7PM. 
Line178 I opened up my favorites list in the app. I should leave a congratulatory comment to encourage the author since I was the only reader. But...
Line179 — This work does not exist.
Line180 I tried typing “apocalypse” several times in the search box, but the results were the same. The bulletin board for TWSA had also disappeared without a trace. 
Line181 That’s strange. Was there ever a case of a novel being deleted without warning when it was going to be monetized?
Line182 At that moment, the lights in the subway went out, and the inside of the train was plunged into darkness.
Line183 Screeeeech—! 
Line184 The subway shook violently, and the sound of grinding metal pierced my ears. People were thrown around in the carriage. Yoo Sangah let out a small yelp of fright as she grabbed my arm. She gripped it so hard that the pain was enough to drown out the surrounding chaos.
Line185 It took a dozen seconds for the emergency brakes to bring the train to a full stop. Confused voices broke out from all around. 
Line186 "Uh, what?" 
Line187 "W-What is this?"
Line188 Cell phone lights flickered on one by one in the darkness. Yoo Sangah continued to hold on to my left arm tightly. 
Line189 "W-What’s going on?" she asked.
Line190 I pretended to be unbothered as I said, "Don't worry. I’m sure it’s nothing." 
Line191 "Really?"
Line192 “Yes. Worst-case scenario, it’s a suicide attempt. I’m sure the operator will make an announcement soon." 
Line193 As if on cue, I heard the operator’s announcement just as I finished speaking.
Line194 — Attention all passengers. Attention all passengers.
Line195 The loud surroundings became calm.
Line196 I sighed and said, "See? It’s nothing. Now an apology will air, and then the power will come back on–"
Line197 — E-Everyone, run away…! Run–! 
Line198 What?
Line199 The broadcast cut off with a bzzzt, and the subway became chaotic. 
Line200 "D-Dokja-ssi? What the hell–?" 
Line201 A bright light flashed from the front of the subway carriage. Then came a loud sound like a canvas was being torn in two. 
Line202 Something was headed toward us in the darkness. 
Line203 It was just a coincidence that I happened to glance at the time at this exact moment. 
Line204 7:00PM.
Line205 Tick. 
Line206 It felt like the world had stopped. And then a voice resounded. 
Line207 [The free service of planetary system 8612 has been terminated.] 
Line208 [The main scenario has begun.]
Line209 This was the moment the genre of my life changed.
